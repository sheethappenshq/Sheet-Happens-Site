        <p>I can be found at any and all of the below links, i check them like every 10 minutes and i have all the notifications set to ping me obnoxiously, 
          so dont worry about me not receiving an email the night before an exam or anything or a DM going unread, i do check them i promise. Send me a 
          DM or email me, it would mean the world, i dont even mind if its unrelated or mean, anything would be pretty cool.

        <h2>How to Buy a Study Sheet :D</h2>

        <p>If you have decided to buy a study sheet from me (I’m not ashamed to be extremely thankful that you’d do that), or 
        you have convinced your wallet‑of‑a‑friend to buy one for you, thanks!</p>

        <p>I have all of the study sheets I’ve ever created in a drive that I’m logged into on multiple devices, 
        so you won’t have to wait more than 5 minutes to receive it. I’ll almost always be able to 
        send it straight away as soon as I get the payment (which also should be instant).</p>

        <p>Speaking of payment, I exclusively accept payments through PayID as it’s the safest option for me since I’m still a student. 
        I won’t have to give out private details, and it’s secure for you as well, since you don’t have to give me any 
        card information. Absolutely NO information is transferred or required on this website — your bank handles everything. 
        All you have to do is go into your banking app, select “pay someone,” and then 
        put in the email address “sheethappenshq@gmail.com”. Please don’t typo here (I have faith in you, don’t worry). 
        My name will come up at this point, and if you confirm with me over DMs or email that it’s correct, 
        then you click pay, I receive your $2–$5, and send you the study sheet of your selection instantly.</p>

        <p>(If you have any questions, like anything at all, please don’t hesitate to ask me about it and I’ll respond as soon as possible :D)</p>
