        <p>I can be found at any and all of the below links, i check them like every 10 minutes and i have all the notifications set to ping me obnoxiously, 
          so dont worry about me not receiving an email the night before an exam or anything or a DM going unread, i do check them i promise. Send me a 
          DM or email me, it would mean the world, i dont even mind if its unrelated or mean, anything would be pretty cool.

        <h2>How to Buy a Study Sheet :D</h2>
        <p>If you have decided to buy a study sheet from me, (im not ashamed to be extremely thankful that you’d do that), or 
          you have convinced your wallet of a friend to buy one for you, thanks!
          <br>
Secondly, I have all of the study sheets that ive ever created in a drive that i am logged into on multiple devices, 
          so you wont have to wait more than 5 minutes to receive it, and i’ll almost always be able to 
          send it straight away as soon as i get the payment. (which also should be instant)
          <br>
Speaking of payment, i exclusively accept payments through PayID as its the most safe option for me since im still a student, 
          and i wont have to give out private details, but also secure for you as well, since you dont have to give me any 
          card information and absolutely NO information is going to be transferred or transmitted or required on this website, 
          your bank will handle everything. All you have to do is just go into your banking app and select pay someone, and then 
          put in the email address “sheethappenshq@gmail.com”, please do not typo here (i have faith in you, dont worry.) my name 
          will come up at this point, and if you confirm with me over DMs or email that it is the correct name, (im sorry i wont 
          share that here), then you click pay, i receive your $2 - $5 and send you the study sheet of your selection instantly as 
          well. Im sorry this one is so long but I think its better to be detailed when it comes to your money and both our security.
          <br>
(if you have any questions, like anything at all, please dont hesitate to ask me about it and i’ll respond as soon as possible :D)
