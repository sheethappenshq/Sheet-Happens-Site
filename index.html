      <h2>Q&A</h2>
      <p class="question">Q: Is this one of those generic boring Wix.com websites with the dodgy watermark everywhere?</p>
      <p class="answer">A: I‚Äôll be honest with you, I really didnt want to make one of those generic free wordpress websites where someone tries to sell you a product that costs
        15 times what it should cuz they annoy me. This website was a hobby of mine long before Sheet Happens even existed, and for that reason I‚Äôve 
        kept the games page open as a relic from before I started trying to integrate this second hobby into it :D </p>

      <p class="question">Q: Is this one of those cringy corporate Q&A sections where they try and sell themselves or their product 147 different ways??
</p>
      <p class="answer">A: NO and flip u for asking (im kidding but also this is not one of 
        those Q&A sections i promise, (also why do they always have like 4000 emojis its so bad))
</p>

      <p class="question">Q: Why the flop would i even spend money on u i dont even know u
</p>
      <p class="answer">A: Well if youre even a little bit like me, you also didn‚Äôt study until it‚Äôs the night before your exam (and maybe even 
        why you‚Äôre on my website right now‚Ä¶). I know the feeling, trust me, that's the only reason I started making these in the first place, by 
        trying to fit as much as I could into a piece of paper and read it on the way to school, or even my phone in particularly dire times. 
        Prelims are stressful enough, let alone trying to learn the entire syllabus the night before an exam so i found these helped a lot. 
        I promise im not sponsoring myself, it feels a bit better to know that if i remember whats on the sheet ill do okay in the exam.
</p>

      <p class="question">Q: Why charge money you greedy corporate scum!!!  (yappola response incoming)
</p>
      <p class="answer">A: To be honest the main reason I‚Äôm charging anything at all is to try and save enough to break even on hosting this website (fees pmoüò≠) 
        and to maybe give these out for free if i can afford to in the future cuz i know thats something i would have enjoyed, 
        i promise there is no malicious corporate greed behind my pricing cough cough studoku coughcough. All the study sheets I made were created using all syllabus 
        dot points and as much exam tips as i can possibly fit onto a piece of paper (I know this because i use them myself and im paranoid about missing bits of the syllabus incase its the 25 marker question.......). 
</p>

      <p class="question">Q: Why should I pay you at all for this??? >:0
</p>
      <p class="answer">A: You might be wondering, ‚Äúuh but cant i just use ai to do it for me and it wont cost a cent???‚Äù Well, yes, but also no, trust me I tried that too. 
        AI literally is not capable of effectively making these, I would know as it was the first thing I turned to after finding nothing online for last minute 
        study sheets (that didnt require uploading like 12 study documents and waiting hours for approval or spending like 15 bucks ts is crazy work), 
        but the crappola it spat out was so awful I literally gave up and just decided to do it myself. (While certain friends and family with dollar signs 
        lighting up in their eyes said to charge far more for these, at the end of the day they‚Äôre really just something that can save you some stress and a 
        couple of hours before an exam, and to be fair I genuinely wouldn't pay more than 2 to 5 bucks for one of these anyway, no matter how much of a pinch 
        im in (thats how these even came to exist‚Ä¶) so i dont see any point in charging any more than i would pay.)
</p> 
      
      <p class="question">Q: Final Notes (DISCOUNT ALERT)!!!!
</p>
      <p class="answer">A: The first thing I'd recommend if you dont want to spend any money is to get a particularly generous friend to buy whatever you need 
        or could both use and then just send a copy of it to you as well (I dont mind losing $2, I know I know, so generous). 
        If you really really are in some trouble before your exam and you don‚Äôt wanna pay a cent (or you have no friends), 
        i honestly understand, send me an email or DM me! I‚Äôll see if theres anything i can do to help or just make sure you pass that exam, cuz i know that feeling all too well.
